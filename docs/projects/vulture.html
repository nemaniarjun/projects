<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>The motivation, here, is to extend the functionality of vulture as a library,
and to pass on all metadata through the API and then to harness this utility in
VultureBear for auto removing dead code, which would greatly optimise the bear.
The second part of this project focuses on offering the source range of the
dead code which would make auto-removal much easier. As of now, vulture only
supplies the beginning of the dead code. Also, it proposes to enhance vulture
in order to detect unreachable code(like <code class="highlighter-rouge">if False</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if True else</code>, any code
written after return statements, etc). - this shall helpthe user in trimming
down their codebase without affecting usability. Also, the third part would be
to implement a confidence value for every result, this shall be helpful when
tackling false positives.</p>

<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Modify vulture, such as to extend its core functionality as a library.</li>
  <li>Refactor VultureBear accordingly for ensuring optimal performance.</li>
  <li>Implement a method to acquire the source range of dead code and make suitable
changes in the API and Bear.</li>
  <li>Detect the instances of unreachable code, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">if False</code> statements</li>
  <li>Analyse and implement a confidence value for results.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="specifications">Specifications</h4>

<h5 id="1-realise-vultures-api-in-vulturebear">1.) Realise vulture’s API in VultureBear</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Extending vulture’s API: This would allow the user to find all the unused
code through a single abstract layer: <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_unused_code</code>. This can be easily
implemented, given the already existing Vulture.scan(), Vulture.report(),
Vulture.unused_funcs(), etc. with minimal changes in vulture’s code base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhance VultureBear</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Refactor VultureBear to directly fetch results through get_unused_code
(API), thus making it more efficient- we would have memory files passing
(An extra layer of parsing would then be removed)</li>
      <li>Further enhancements in vulture (detect unreachable code and reporting
ranges of dead code)  would influence the API, which would also need
refactoring of the Bear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="2-improving-default-whitelist">2.) Improving default whitelist</h5>

<p>The first step here would be to make the whitelist default. The important thing
would be to identify possible cases which might cause vulture to report a false
positive. This can be achieved through extensive testing with major projects
(trending python projects on github would cater to our need for the purpose).
This approach would serve us many benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can identify instances of what should ideally be in our whitelist file
as we may find any lesser known constructs.</li>
  <li>We can test vulture for any unreported bugs.</li>
  <li>We can find many projects which use/might want to use vulture - they may
further collaborate with us in making the whitelists together.</li>
  <li>We can also make whitelists for popular python frameworks like Django, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="3-acquiring-source-range-and-implementing-auto-removal">3.) Acquiring source range and implementing auto-removal</h5>

<p>Analyse and discuss with the community the utilities of ast or enhanced pyflake
ast for what would better cater to our problem and would offer simplicity for
source-range acquisition and arrive at a concrete conclusion. Also, there was
another proposal by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/m0hawk">@m0hawk</a> to get everything
until the next node starts. Dialogue here - <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/issues/25">#25</a></p>

<p>Also, if able to fetch the source range successfully, implement the pathway
through which  the metadata flows in and out of API, this would not require
much work because  we can easily change item.lineno (int) to item.dead_range
(tuple of ints) and can parse them over in the VultureBear.</p>

<h5 id="4-detecting-unreachable-code">4.) Detecting unreachable code</h5>

<p>We would first need to identify cases where code cannot be reached. Some of the
common ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">If False</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">If True; else</code></li>
  <li>Any code after <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement in the block containing return itself.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">raise</code> statement  in <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar constructs would have to be looked onto. The crude form would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyse the ast’s</li>
  <li>Look for the if nodes</li>
  <li>Check the boolean affiliated to it, tracking previous arguments.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="5-implementing-a-confidence-value-for-results">5.) Implementing a confidence value for results</h5>

<p>We would need to analyse every construct individually on a case by case basis.
For example, we already know that import statements can be predicted with 100%
surety (except for * imports, where it would be 0%), but functions often have
false-positives.</p>

<p>The confidence value will be alike the ones given below: (The finer grained
distinctions will need further discussion)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">import</code> –&gt;  <code class="highlighter-rouge">100%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">from foo import *</code> –&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">0%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">variable</code> –&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;100%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">function</code> –&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;100%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> –&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;100%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">if False</code> –&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">100%</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

<h5 id="pre---community-bonding-period-up-till--may-4">Pre - Community Bonding Period (Up Till  May 4)</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Initial investigation and discussion on what features to be added to API, and
start implementing them on the go.</li>
  <li>Continue discussion with the community on ast and enhanced pyflakes ast -
What are the underlying differences, and what can be possible implementations
for source range acquisition.</li>
  <li>Diagnose possible cases which would render the code unreachable.</li>
  <li>Inculcate a habit of downloading the trending project of the day, running
vulture on it, analyzing the results and adding anything suitable to
whitelist file. This would help us in maintaining a rich whitelist file.</li>
  <li>Prioritize all the goals and targets</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="community-bonding-may-5---30">Community Bonding (May 5 - 30)</h5>

<ul>

<h6 id="week-1--2-may-31---june-13">Week 1 &amp; 2 (May 31 - June 13)</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Implement API - At this point, we would have a fully functioning API, and we
would be ready to incorporate these changes into the VultureBear.</li>
  <li>Refactor VultureBear to incorporate API - This would be relatively easy as
the API would have had until now respected it’s usage in the VultureBear.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="week-3-june-14---20">Week 3 (June 14 - 20)</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Realize VultureBear completely - At this point, it should be able to execute
vulture, parse output, produce the patch file for removing the dead code what
so ever found.</li>
  <li>Review the tests written so far and add relevant test cases.</li>
  <li>Document Bear</li>
  <li>API documentation including, but not limited to possible use cases, example
code snippets</li>
  <li>See that code is completely documented in place</li>
  <li>Buffer time to finish pending work.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="week-4-june-20---26">Week 4 (June 20 - 26)</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Develop an analysis report on what all constructs can we detect with complete
surety,  partial surety and the ones we cannot detect for the sake of
implementing a confidence value with results. (A crude version is here in
this thread).</li>
  <li>Discuss on the levels of certainty we would need to have (perhaps four for
highly accurate (100%), accurate (&gt;80%), medium (70 - 80%) and can’t say)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="coding-phase-2">Coding Phase 2</h5>
